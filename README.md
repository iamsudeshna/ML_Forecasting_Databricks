# Big Data Assignment: Customers & Orders Analysis

## ðŸ“– Introduction

This assignment focuses on analyzing **Customers** and **Orders** datasets using **PySpark** in a Big Data environment.
The goal is to apply **data engineering and analytics techniques** to derive meaningful insights from raw datasets, while demonstrating proficiency in working with distributed data processing systems.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

1. Import and load datasets (Customers and Orders) into PySpark DataFrames.
2. Perform schema inspection and basic exploratory analysis.
3. Apply **data cleaning** and **transformations**.
4. Use **joins** to combine Customers and Orders datasets.
5. Generate insights such as:

   * Number of unique customers and orders
   * Orders per customer
   * Identification of high-value customers
   * Order distribution trends


## ðŸ›  Tools and Technologies

* **Programming Language**: Python
* **Framework**: PySpark (executed in Databricks / local Spark environment)
* **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / Databricks Notebook
* **Libraries Used**:

  * `pyspark.sql` for DataFrames and queries
  * `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for optional visualization

## ðŸ“Š Methodology

1. **Data Ingestion**

   * Load Customers and Orders datasets from CSV/JSON.

2. **Data Exploration**

   * Inspect schema, column data types, and record counts.

3. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handle null values, duplicates, and inconsistent records.

4. **Data Transformation**

   * Apply filters, groupings, and aggregations.
   * Normalize and enrich columns where needed.

5. **Data Analysis**

   * Join Customers and Orders datasets.
   * Compute order counts per customer.
   * Identify top customers and high-value transactions.
   * Explore temporal and categorical distributions.

6. **Results Documentation**

   * Present outputs as tables and visualizations.
   * Interpret results with brief observations.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Sample Results

* Total number of customers: **N**
* Total number of orders: **M**
* Top 5 customers by number of orders.
* Average revenue per customer.
* Distribution of orders by region/country.

*(The actual numbers and tables are available inside the notebook.)*

## ðŸ“‘ Conclusion

This assignment demonstrates how **PySpark** can be effectively used for:

* Managing large-scale datasets.
* Performing advanced data transformations and joins.
* Deriving business-relevant insights from raw data.

It reinforces the importance of **Big Data tools** in handling real-world datasets where traditional methods may not be efficient.

Do you want me to also **add sections for "Assignment Questions & Answers"** (like Q1, Q2, Q3 â†’ solution summary) in the README, in case your professor expects the results to be explicitly listed?
